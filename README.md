# Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision

Let’s talk about what you’re going to learn in the Applied AI Lab!

The Lab consists of 6 end-to-end projects that will teach you the core concepts behind neural networks. You’ll start each project by using techniques for preparing data before building deep learning models with Pytorch and Transformers.

Much like the WQU student community is distributed all over the globe, the different projects cover a variety of topics from all around the world.

Let’s go through the projects one by one to give you a sense of the diversity of computer vision applications:

* Project 1 is about Wildlife Conservation in Côte d'Ivoire. You’ll assess a data science competition designed to help scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve.
* Project 2 takes you to Uganda, where you’ll build a neural network to classify images of crop disease.
From there, we travel to Bangladesh for Project 3 to create an object detection model to monitor traffic in Dhaka.
* In Project 4, we’ll perform face detection and recognition tasks using a video interview of Indian Olympic boxer Mary Kom.
* Project 5 takes us to Spain, where we’ll use neural networks to generate a variety of medical images.
* For Project 6, we’ll explore social media marketing in the United States.
Projects will include supervised learning tasks, such as image classification and object detection, and unsupervised learning tasks, such as generative AI for image synthesis. You will apply self-regulated learning techniques for exploring software libraries and debugging code. Throughout your project work, you will also consider the ethical and environmental impact of computer vision models, and learn techniques to build models emphasizing fairness and sustainability. Finally, you’ll learn from practicing data scientists about the central values and concerns in the field.

Once you have completed the Lab, you'll be equipped with end-to-end computer vision skills, from data preparation and **ETL**  processes to model development and deployment, enabling you to solve real-world challenges across industries. You'll learn how to clean and transform visual data, train custom computer vision models, and leverage transfer learning techniques.

## Project 1 Overview 
In this project, you'll look at a data science competition helping scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve. The goal is to take images from camera traps and classify which animal, if any, is present. To complete the competition, you'll expand your machine learning skills by creating more powerful neural network models that can take images as inputs and classify them into one of multiple categories.

Some of the things you'll learn are:

* How to read image files and prepare them for machine learning
* How to use PyTorch to manipulate tensors and build a neural network model
* How to build a Convolutional Neural Network that works well with images
* How to use that model to make predictions on new images
* How to turn those predictions into a submission to the competition
